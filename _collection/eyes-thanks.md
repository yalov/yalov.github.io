It’s the software that protect your eyes: the app frequently alerts you to take rest breaks by showing fullscreen image (random image from the folder).

It supports **multiple monitors system** and wide image for all monitors.

<br>

### Download Eyes' Thanks v{{page.version}} for Windows 7–10 (x86, portable) — [.7z](https://github.com/yalov/eyes-thanks/releases/download/{{page.version}}/EyesThanks_v{{page.version}}.7z)

<br>
#### tips:

* You can use `delete` key for delete displayed image from your images folder.
* Middle click to notification area icon — pause timer.
* Use “alternative image folder”, if you have two different-ratio sets of monitors.  
  <small>For example if sometimes you disconnect your FullHD notebook from your FullHD monitor, put 2FHD (3860×1080) pictures to “pictures folder” and FullHD (1920×1080)
  pictures to “alternative pictures folder”.  
  So, a laptop is connected to a monitor — the app uses 2FHD folder, a laptop isn’t connected anywhere — the app uses FullHD folder.</small>
