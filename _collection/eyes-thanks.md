It’s the software that protect your eyes: the app frequently alerts you to take rest breaks by showing fullscreen image (random image from the folder).

It supports **multiple monitors system** and wide image for all monitors.

<br>

### Download Eyes' Thanks v{{page.version}} for Windows 7–10 (x86, portable) — [.7z](https://github.com/yalov/eyes-thanks/releases/download/{{page.version}}/EyesThanks_v{{page.version}}.7z)

<br>
For English version just remove *languages/* and *setting.ini* from app folder.
Also you can use `q` and `escape` hotkeys for finish your rest break, and `delete` — for delete active image from your images folder.

Middle click to notification area icon — pause timer.
