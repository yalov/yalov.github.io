message: "Is your company or organization's name secure?\r\n\r\nWith the release by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) of new top-level domain extensions like .inc, .law, & .shop it is now more important than ever to protect your name and your brand. Your organization's traditional dot.COM domain name may be exposed to fraudulent 'phishing' or 'spoofing' attacks in which criminals try to fool your customers into thinking they are dealing with a legitimate entity. The time to purchase domains related to your own is now. As the initial registrant, the cost of securing new domain names is very reasonable... Trying to gain control of a domain AFTER someone else registers it can run into the tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nSecure your name, secure your reputation, and secure your brand.\r\n\r\nVisit http://bit.ly/MerchantEngineDomains to register domain extensions related to yours at the lowest possible price. New domain names can be forwarded to your existing website for free, or used in unique marketing campaigns, we are always ready to help. We offer a full range of corporate email, website hosting, and encryption products as well; all through GoDaddy, a name you know you can trust."
