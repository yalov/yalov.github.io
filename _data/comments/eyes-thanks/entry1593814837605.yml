message: "ABOLISH REACTIVE DEPRESSION AND EMERGE FROM ITS DEEP, DARK, BLACK HOLE?\r\n• Do you feel this came from the beginnings of a dysfunctional family system?\r\n• Or did this come from the loss of a beloved job or loved one?\r\n• Or did this come from dire effects from the disease of Alcoholism?\r\n• Or did this come from the brainwashing attempts of a fearful and angry world, i.e. terroristic recruitment?\r\nDo you know that whatever caused this DEEP, DARK, BLACK HOLE OF DEPRESSION which may have come from a NERVOUS BREAKDOWN can cease its influence over your life? Yes, you do not have to live buried in negative thinking from the defeat from negative life experiences in your life. Please know that any tragic experiences from childhood to adulthood need no longer affect your chance to gain emotional wellbeing.\r\nInstead, now you have the opportunity to be HAPPY and in PEACEFUL CONTROL OF YOUR OWN DESTINY with only the memory of what once ailed you. Now is the time to overcome depression and begin to take control over your life. Not only that, you alone have the opportunity to reverse negative thinking and achieve your very own POSITIVE BELIEF SYSTEM.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Your views on spirituality or religion will not prevent you from successfully implementing your own PARENTAL SELF-LOVE PROCESS to ACHIEVE PURPOSE, MOTIVATION, GOOD SELF-ESTEEM, SUCCESS, AND MORE. Yes, like Lin Tillman did, you too can ACHIEVE MORE THAN YOU ASKED FOR and make meaningful and healthy contributions to this planet.\r\nYou can learn more about Lin’s journey in her book The Invisible Girl & GOD, where she shares her TRUE STORY of how she healed herself from an agonizing depression with suicidal ideations.\r\nGO TO: https://bit.ly/Depression-self-help to learn more"
