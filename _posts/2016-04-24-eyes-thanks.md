It’s the software that protect your eyes: the app frequently alerts you to take rest breaks by showing fullscreen image (random image from the folder).

It supports **multiple monitors system** and wide image for all monitors.

**Eyes' Thanks v0.98.0 for Windows XP–10 (x86, portable, 7z) — [Download](https://bitbucket.org/flart/eyes-thanks/downloads/EyesThanks_v0.98.0.7z)**

For english version just remove *lang_ru.qm* and *setting.ini* at app folder.
Also you can use `q` and `delete` hotkeys for close and delete active image, respectively.
