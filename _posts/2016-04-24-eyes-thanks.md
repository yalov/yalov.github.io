It’s the software that protect your eyes: the app frequently alerts you to take rest breaks by showing fullscreen image (random image from the folder).

It supports **multiple monitors system** and wide image for all monitors.

**Download Eyes' Thanks v{{page.version}} for Windows XP–10 (x86, portable) —
[.7z](https://github.com/yalov/eyes-thanks/releases/download/{{page.version}}/EyesThanks_v{{page.version}}.7z)**

For english version just remove *lang_ru.qm* and *setting.ini* at app folder.
Also you can use `q` and `delete` hotkeys for close and delete active image, respectively.
